# Product-Mapping-System
This project makes it easier to match product names from supplier invoices to standardized names in the buyer's system. Using text normalization and a dynamic mapping dictionary, it handles naming variations efficiently. The system saves time, reduces errors, and supports both manual and automated matching processes.
